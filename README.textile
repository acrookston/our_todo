h1. our.todo

A tiny web based ToDo application.

This little project was brought into the world when I was given a small developer task to complete as a test.
The test only stated to create the html and css code but I decided to create a fully functioning application out of what I had created.

I only posted it to Github for fun but you are free to use this in any way you like under the MIT license.
